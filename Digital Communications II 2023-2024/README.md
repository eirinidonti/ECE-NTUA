- _ADSL-DMT System Emulation_: Code creation in order to display the 16-QAM constellation with the associated 4-bit codes shown next to each point of the constellation and QAM decoding with error counting.

- _BCH Code_: Code creation for the appropriate circular code BCH (15,k) including three correctable errors with emulation of BCH encoding and decoding processes.
  
-_Reed-Solomon Codification_: Application of Reed-Solomon decoder based on Euclid's GCD calculation algorithm/autoregression technique and includes Reed-Solomon encoder in the ATSC digital television broadcast system.
