- _Discrete-Time Signals_: Explore the characteristics and properties of discrete-time signals, analyze different types of signals, such as periodic, aperiodic, digital signals, perform operations such as sampling, quantization and digital-to-analog conversion.

- _Design/Implementation of FIR Digital Filters_: Designing and implementing Finite Impulse Response (FIR) digital filters focusing on filter specifications, filter design techniques and practical implementation considerations.

- _Adaptive Filters and L-ASK_: Exercises related to adaptive filters and L-ASK (Amplitude-Shift Keying) focusing on channel equalization or noise cancellation.

- _Nyquist Filters_: Explore pulse shaping techniques like Raised Cosine and Root Raised Cosine filters, concept of Nyquist pulse and filter design for achieving the Nyquist criterion.

- _QAM-PSK_: Exercises on Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) and Phase-Shift Keying (PSK) modulation schemes, such as signal constellations, modulation/demodulation techniques for QAM and PSK and simulate their performance in noisy channels.

- _FSK-MSK_: Exercises related to Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK) and Minimum Shift Keying (MSK), such as analyze principles of FSK and MSK modulation, their spectral properties and simulate their performance under various noise conditions.
