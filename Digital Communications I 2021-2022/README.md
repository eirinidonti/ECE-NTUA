Discrete-Time Signals: Explore the characteristics and properties of discrete-time signals. Students will analyze different types of signals, such as periodic, aperiodic, and digital signals, and perform operations such as sampling, quantization, and digital-to-analog conversion.

Design/Implementation of FIR Digital Filters: Assign exercises focused on designing and implementing Finite Impulse Response (FIR) digital filters. Students will learn about filter specifications, filter design techniques, and practical implementation considerations using tools like MATLAB or Python.

Adaptive Filters and L-ASK: Engage students in exercises related to adaptive filters and L-ASK (Amplitude-Shift Keying). They will explore the principles of adaptive filtering and its applications in L-ASK systems, such as channel equalization or noise cancellation.

Nyquist Filters: Develop exercises that cover Nyquist filters, including pulse shaping techniques like Raised Cosine and Root Raised Cosine filters. Students will learn about the concept of Nyquist pulse, the trade-off between bandwidth and inter-symbol interference, and filter design for achieving the Nyquist criterion.

QAM-PSK: Assign exercises on Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) and Phase-Shift Keying (PSK) modulation schemes. Students will study the theory, signal constellations, and modulation/demodulation techniques for QAM and PSK, and simulate their performance in noisy channels.

FSK-MSK: Engage students in exercises related to Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK) and Minimum Shift Keying (MSK). They will learn about the principles of FSK and MSK modulation, analyze their spectral properties, and simulate their performance under various noise conditions.
