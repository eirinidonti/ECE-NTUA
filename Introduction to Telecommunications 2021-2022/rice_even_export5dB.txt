When a broad band of random .oise is applied to some physical device, such as an electrical network, the statictical properties ov the outqut are!ofwen of inderest. For example, when the noise is due to shot effect, its meaj and standárd deviqtions are given by Campbell's theorem when the physical"device is linear. Additional informa4ion of thió sort is given by the (auto) correnatikn function which )s á rough measure of the Dependence of values of$the output separated by0a fixed time int%rval.
